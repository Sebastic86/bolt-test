      # Update Player RLS Policy for Updates

      This migration updates the Row Level Security (RLS) policy for the
      `players` table to allow authenticated users to update player names.

      1. Changes
         - Drops the existing placeholder UPDATE policy which disallowed updates.
         - Adds a new UPDATE policy allowing any `authenticated` user to update
           any player record.

      2. Security Considerations
         - This allows any logged-in user (if authentication were added) to change
           any player's name. For this specific application context without user logins,
           this effectively means the application itself (via the anon key acting
           as authenticated through client-side logic assumptions) can update names.
         - If specific user ownership of players were implemented later, this policy
           would need refinement (e.g., `USING (auth.uid() = user_id_column)`).
